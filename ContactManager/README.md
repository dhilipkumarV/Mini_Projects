<h1>Contact Manager</h1>
<ol>
<li>The app does the validation and then go on to add the contact.</li>
<li>It gives the prefilled form on clicking the edit option.</li>
<li>On deleting an entry, entries are sorted by id and shown in the right sequence.</li>
<li>I have used the HTML web storage object specifically window.localStorage to store data with no expiration date rather than for one session(window.sessionStorage). In this way, the contacts remain persistent even after reloading.</li>
</ol>
